Example Sims2 Body Meshes

These meshes are the standard "default" body meshes that are used by BodyShop.

There is no need to credit me, I did nothing to them at all.

They are handy to use as a reference if you are working on hair or accessory meshes.

They are supplied in .obj file format -

This means they should be compatible with all 3d Editors -

NOTE:  These meshes are for REFERENCE ONLY!  They can NOT be imported back into the game,
they have no joint assignments!

To use:

First import the mesh you are working on into your 3d editor, in your chosen format

This can be .obj, .ms3dascii, .smd, or direct import into MilkShape with Wes H's plugins.

Then import the example .obj

With some 3d editors or export/import methods you may need to rotate the example mesh - 
as supplied, they are in the correct position for .obj files exported as XZY, .ms3dascii files 
exported as XZY, and with Wes H's plugins.

Do your editing, using the example mesh groups as a reference for locating your new mesh parts.

Be sure to DELETE ALL the example mesh groups before you export your finished mesh.

I hope you find these useful.
